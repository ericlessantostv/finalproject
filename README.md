2DGameDesignProject2 Final

##General Info: This project is to build a Beserk style arcade game.

##How to Play: To play use keys UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT, W, D, A, S to move accordingly. To attack press SPACE. There are 3 levels with different enemies. If you collide with an enemy you die.

##Additional Info for the project: In Beserk if you collide with a wall, you die. I have deactivated for this project because it didn't make sense for the tiles I used. The code for the collision-die is still there but commented out.

##What doesn't work: Unfortunately I had trouble with handling the enemy lists in the other scenes last minute so enemy collisions for the next levels does not work as expected. Server works but had problems setting up the client side. Also my computer broke so I was not able to work on it as much as I would have liked.
